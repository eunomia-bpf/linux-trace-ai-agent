# trace-agent

`trace-agent` is an agent for automatic monitoring of system performance. It leverages a combination of available monitoring tools and the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to analyze the resource utilization of a specific process identified by its PID. The project aims to provide detailed insights and recommendations by examining the codebase.
